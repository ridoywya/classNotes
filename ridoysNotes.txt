Simplified Notes

Comments (#):

Comments start with # and are ignored by the computer.
They explain code and serve as reminders.
No limit on the number or detail of comments.
echo Command:

Displays messages on the screen (like making the computer "speak").
Useful for prompts, comments, instructions, and testing code.
Remove echo statements after troubleshooting.
Variables:

Containers that store values (e.g., age_years, age_days).
read -p "Enter your age in years: " age_years takes user input and stores it.
Use echo to display variable values for troubleshooting.
if Statement:

Checks if a condition is true, controlling script flow.
Validates user input.
Regex (^[0-9]+$):

A pattern to match text (regular expression).
Ensures input is only digits (0-9).
^ = start, $ = end, [0-9] = any digit, + = one or more.
Learning resource: regexlearn.com/learn/regex101
[[ ]] and !~:

[[ ]] tests conditions in Bash.
!~ means "does not match."
Example: [[ ! $age_years =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] checks if input isn’t a number.
Explore other conditionals: ==, |, >, <, -eq, -ne, -gt.
Arithmetic Calculation ($(( ))):

$(( )) performs math calculations in Bash.
Example: age_days=$((age_years * 365)) calculates days from years.
Exit Code (exit 1):

exit 1 ends the script with an error code (indicating something went wrong).
Stops if user input is invalid.
Use echo to clarify the error for users.
